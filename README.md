Repository for my MATLAB beamforming simulator

This repository contains my single cell wireless simulator for MIMO system with one relay.

To run the simulator run the file simulador_sgb.m. The configurations of the simulation are in the files simulador_sgb.m and Parameters.m.

This program was developed by Ricardo Brauner dos Santos as part of the research in Beamforming in multicast systems in the Universidade Federal do Ceará.
